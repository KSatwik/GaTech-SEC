## GaTech-SEC EDGAR - Project by K.Satwik

### EDGAR

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for maintaining the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR), an online repository that was initially built in 1993. Its purpose is to automate the process of gathering, validating, and accepting submissions and announcements by companies that are legally required to do so. A compilation of data that was scraped from this repository is called the Edgar Schema. The tables in this database schema are made up of several main tables that contain the most basic data from EDGAR as well as several dependent tables that are typically created by scraping and cleaning data from filings and documents that are linked from the main tables, like the set of tables that list the information contained in the Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5 filings. 

### What is 10k fillings?
10-K is short for Form 10-K, which is a document the SEC requires all public companies to file each year. The form presents a financial picture of the company, detailing its revenues, assets, and liabilities for the previous year.

### TLDR Implementation
The following shows a high-level implementation that extracts and summarizes Item 1A, Risk Factors from Tesla’s 10-K filing filed in 2020, in 15 sentences.

### Why colab and what is the frontend? ( Task 2 )
Utilizing Google Colab provides a convenient environment for running Python code with access to GPU resources, making it suitable for machine learning and data analysis tasks. 

Streamlit offers an accessible approach to building interactive web applications directly from Python scripts, ideal for showcasing and sharing project outputs without requiring extensive frontend development knowledge. 

( I couldn't complete the same even with the extra time due to few family reasons and power cuts due to rains proof attached as a link (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyderabad-power-outage-after-heavy-rain-and-storm-damage/articleshow/109961474.cms); 

I know it sounds as an excuse but I will try my best to submit whatever I have done. Sorry and thank you for the opportunity )
